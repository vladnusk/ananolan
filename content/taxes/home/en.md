faq:
  - question: Do you work with clients outside the United States?
    answer: Yes. We specialize in helping non-residents, foreign business owners, and new immigrants navigate U.S. tax regulations. All our services are delivered fully online.
  - question: How long does tax preparation take?
    answer: Typical individual returns are completed within 5–7 business days after we receive all documents. Business returns may take 1–2 weeks depending on complexity.
  - question: What documents do I need to provide?
    answer: For individuals, we typically need W-2s, 1099s, and records of deductions. For business returns, we need financial statements, bank records, and receipts. We’ll send you a tailored checklist.
  - question: Do you offer year-round support?
    answer: Yes. We provide ongoing bookkeeping, tax planning, and advisory support throughout the year, not just during tax season.
